# Uncontrolled Goroutines: A Problem in Concurrent Applications

In Go, goroutines are lightweight and efficient, but when not managed properly, they can lead to **resource exhaustion**, including an unbounded increase in goroutines, high CPU usage, and degraded application performance.

---

## Problem Description

The following example spawns a new goroutine each time a job is added to the `jobs` channel. The result is an **unbounded increase** in the number of goroutines, as there is no mechanism to control their creation.

### Code Example: Uncontrolled Goroutines

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "runtime"
 "time"
)

func main() {
 jobs := make(chan int, 10) // Buffered channel to hold jobs
 for {
  jobs <- 1          // Add a job to the channel
  go worker(jobs)    // Spawn a new goroutine for each job
 }
}

func worker(jobs chan int) {
 fmt.Printf("Number of goroutines: %d, Number of CPUs: %d\n", runtime.NumGoroutine(), runtime.NumCPU())
 time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate job processing
 <-jobs                      // Remove the job from the channel
}
```

---

## Observed Behavior

When running this code, you will notice the following:

- **Uncontrolled Goroutine Growth**: Each iteration spawns a new goroutine without any limit, increasing `runtime.NumGoroutine` continuously.
- **Resource Drain**: The CPU usage may remain manageable for a while but eventually lead to system strain or even a crash if left unchecked.

### Sample Output

```
Number of goroutines: 2, Number of CPUs: 4
Number of goroutines: 3, Number of CPUs: 4
Number of goroutines: 4, Number of CPUs: 4
...
```

## The Solution: Managing Goroutines with a Worker Pool

Instead of spawning an uncontrolled number of goroutines, you can use a **worker pool** to limit the number of active goroutines. The worker pool processes jobs from the channel in a controlled manner, ensuring efficient resource usage.

### Key Changes to Address the Problem

1. Use a **fixed number of workers** to process jobs concurrently.
2. Use a **channel** to queue jobs and coordinate workers.
3. Control the **lifetime of goroutines** and prevent excessive creation.

---

## Why This Matters?

- **Prevents Resource Exhaustion**: Limits the number of active goroutines, avoiding high memory and CPU usage.
- **Improves Stability**: Ensures predictable and stable application behavior in production.
- **Enhances Performance**: Efficiently utilizes available CPUs and handles jobs without overwhelming the system.

### Next Steps

To control goroutine growth, implement the **worker pool pattern** and modify the code to cap the number of active goroutines

By being mindful of how goroutines are created and managed, you can ensure your Go applications remain efficient, scalable, and production-ready. ðŸ’¡
